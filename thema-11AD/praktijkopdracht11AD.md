## Inhoud

This theme is the first half of the minor "Application Design". Designing an application is a very diverse activity; it involves gathering requirements from the client, assessing their priority and feasibility, translating the requirements into a technical design document, and finally implementing the design in a robust, reliable, extensible manner. This theme visits all of these aspects with a project of your own choosing. 

**Assessment**
This course will be assessed based on several aspects: day-to-day performance, your product and your communication skills (both orally and on paper). In detail, these aspects will be taken into account when grading your work: 
- Software specification document
- Project execution (professional attitude)
- Application of the Scrum methodology (including Trello as project management tool and Scrum meetings)
- Poster and Poster pitch
- Product implementation (start), including Testing and Logging
