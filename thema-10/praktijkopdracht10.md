## Cursusdoelen (leerdoelen)
After following this course, the student will be able to 
- Translate a given concise problem outline in a proposal into a  manageable web application and database system using Java (web-) technology.
- Interact with a (technically) ignorant customer and come to a satisfying product
- Work relatively independent on a single project and plan its aspects professionally
- Generate quality software documentation

## Inhoud

During the project you will work on a research project that you choose from several that are available at the start of the project. All projects will have several aspects in common, revolving around web technology and phylogenetic aspects. This project is organized in close collaboration with the module Web-based Information Systems I. Therefore, attendance of this module (in this quarter or in a previous year) is strongly advised. Also, it is advised to have finished the courses Introduction Java and Databases 1.

**beoordeling**

Grading is based on the end product made available through a (Bitbucket) online code repository as well as a software report that describes usage of the web product given a described use-case. Individual grading applies if the repository commit-history as well as source file metadata (author) indicates an imbalance in productivity.

**beoordelingscriteria**
1. Web Application: **40%**
    - a. usage
    - b. functionality
    - c. interface
2. Code base: **40%**
    - a. presence of proper project-documentation (`README.md`)
    - b. presence of generated Java-doc
    - c. proper use of Git (commit messages, number of commits and merge-strategy)
    - d. code structure (dividing of code into packages and modules)
    - e. quality (proper use of language features and documentation)
3. Report: **20%**
