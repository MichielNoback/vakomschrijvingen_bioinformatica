- use the R IDE RStudio for writing and executing R code
- use R Markdown to create reporting documents with embedded R code and output
- read R documentation and apply these to your work cases
- know the basic R data types (vectors, lists and data frames), and how to use and manipulate them

## Contents

R is a programming language and software environment for data analysis, statistical computing and visualization. In this course you will learn to use R in these three areas, in particular data analysis and visualization. 

**Assessment**
This course will be assessed using a 2-hour practical computer test. 

You are supposed to give all solutions/answers in an R Markdown file and submit both the markdown file and a PDF document generated from this Markdown file. These aspects will be taken into account when grading your work (on a per-question basis):
- Correctness and quality (efficiency/effectiveness) of the solution
- The completeness of figures (axes, legends, titles)
